## What is the third ferromagnetic goblin?

Iron Cobalt and Nickel are sometimes known as the "[Iron Triad](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_General_Chemistry_(Petrucci_et_al.)/23%3A_The_Transition_Elements/23.5%3A_The_Iron_Triad%3A_Iron_Cobalt_and_Nickel)" or Iron Group due to their similar properties. 

What is the the origin of the word 'iron'?
It's not entirely clear.
But it [may be a derivative](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/14777/etymology-of-iron-semantic-change) of ancient words related to blood, strength, or supernatural power.

For the other two, the etymology is well-known.
Cobalt derives its name from the [Kobold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold) of European mythology.
Nickel (originally *Kupfernickel*, meaning *goblin's copper*) similarly derives its name from a mischievous mythological mountain monster. 

This ~~is unrelated coincidence~~ suggests that iron earns its name from a third variety of goblin, some ferocious underground spirit that plagued our ancestors.
Might it still be around? Forgotten, but far from gone?
What terrible ferro-goblins might still sleep secretly deep within the earth?

## Planetary Elements

There are 8 elements named after celestial objects.  
The seven metals of antiquity have traditionally been [associated with the seven classical planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet#Alchemy), especially Mercury, for which the planet and element share a name.

Between these two factors, there is at least one element associated with each of the major objects in our solar system:

| Planet | Namesake for Element | Classical Association |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| The Sun | Helium | Gold |
| Mercury | Mercury |  |
| Venus |  | Copper |
| Earth | Tellurium |  |
| The Moon | Selenium | Silver |
| Mars |  | Iron |
| Ceres | Cerium |  |
| Pallas | Palladium |  |
| Jupiter |  | Tin |
| Saturn |  | Lead |
| Uranus | Uranium |  |
| Neptune | Neptunium |  |
| Pluto | Plutonium |  |

Though this still leaves many former planets and dwarf planets without an element of their own.

## Interesting Alternate Element Names

Many elements have alternate names,
and there are good reasons for standardizing the names we have.
But some alternate names are fairly interesting.

Tungsten
: Wolfram, from *wolf's froth*, in reference to the difficulties of mining wolframite.
Plutonium
: Extremium or Ultimium, from the false belief that this was the final element.
Mercury
: Quicksilver, or Hydrargyrum, which is Greek for 'water-silver'



<!--Another theory, considered far-fetched in some quarters, traces it to Medieval Latin sodanum "a headache remedy," ultimately from Arabic suda "splitting headache."
azoth/azote = lifeless Yang Air
helium aka 氦 sun vapor| Yin Air
亞-->
