The above graphic depicts the planetary-mass objects (planemos) of the solar system. 
Each celestial object is depicted as a simple solid color circle overlayed with an astronomical symbol,
and accompanied by a brief description of both the object and its namesake.

<!--Sun, major planets, likely and official dwarf planets, and planetary-mass moons.

Object diameters are scaled in proportion to the square root of their actual size.
Distances are not to scale.-->

I made the above infographic for fun and release it under the [CC BY SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),
So feel free to modify this, print this as a poster, whatever, as long as you credit me, Robert Winslow,
and release any derivative works under the same license.

As for origins of the symbols:
The symbols for the major planets, the Sun, Luna, Ceres, and Pluto are all official and recognized by astronomers. 
(This is because all of these objects were at one point considered planets.)
The symbols for the other dwarf planets, the moons of other objects, etc. are unofficial. 
These mostly come from [public domain designs by Denis Moskowitz](https://suberic.net/~dmm/astro/index.html).
The designs for Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Orcus are my own designs (also public domain).


In the links at the bottom of the page, you'll find the notes I took while making this graphic,
which have info and symbols for a lot of little astronomical objects not included in the picture above.
You'll also find a link to a little font I made to help display the symbols for the moons.

Here is a quadratically scaled solar system.
I'm playing around with the symbols for some of the moons.
