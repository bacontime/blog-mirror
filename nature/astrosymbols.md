## Asteroids

People initially thought these were planets and gave them symbols. Around the discovery of 16 Psyche is when astronomers realized there are too many of the dang things to dote on each one individually.

1. Ceres: God of grain, harvest, motherhood.
2. Pallas: Athena and her spear.
3. Juno: God of marriage and childbirth.
4. Vesta: God of hearth and home.
5. Astraea: God of justice, innocence, purity, and precision.
6. Hebe: God of youth and forgiveness, Cupbearer to the gods.
7. Iris: God of rainbows. Messenger of the gods.
8. Flora: God of flowers and springtime.
9. Metis: Titan of wisdom and skilled council. Mother of Athena.
10. Hygiea: God of cleanliness, sanitation, and preventative medicine.
11. Parthenope: Siren. Either failed to lure Odysseus or was turned into a city by Jupiter.
12. Victoria: God of victory.
13. Egeria: 
14. Irene
15. Eunomia
16. Psyche
17. Thetis
18. Melpomene
19. Fortuna

Switch ⚵ to steam, ⚴ to blood, and ... to wood?
Or just swap Juno and Pallas?
Basically, Juno looks like a tree, and the blood spear thing is important in the WtC story.

Maybe use the * ones for air? Or for non-elementals?

Some of the symbols are [modern inventions by Denis Moskowitz](https://suberic.net/~dmm/astro/tno.html). Fortunately, he has entered the designs on these symbols into the public domain.

Here is a quadratically scaled solar system.
I'm playing around with the symbols for some of the moons.
