[Twitter's Whistleblower Report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/twitter-whistleblower-sec-spam/whistleblower_disclosure.pdf)
: There has been much ado over twitter drama since Elon Musk took over the company. But much more shocking and less talked about are the allegations made by a whistleblower back in July 2022. Twitter threads with highlights: [1](https://nitter.net/AvidHalaby/status/1602127460677844993), [2](https://nitter.net/TheMattBeebe/status/1601731247977693184). Among other things, Twitter was apparently doing development on the production environment.

[Life Without Your Cerebellum](https://medium.com/know-your-body/life-without-your-cerebellum-b21e7b976aab)
: I knew that the cerebellum was responsible for 'muscle memory', but I didn't know that it contains half of your brain cells and "has some role in coordinating social stimuli as well as motor". If a person is born without a cerebellum, they can adapt and survive, but will be clumsy and socially stunted.

[H3: Uberâ€™s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://eng.uber.com/h3/)
: Uber has a clever system for implementing a hex-grid tiling of Earth's surface. If you remember your geometry, you know there must also be 12 pentagons in the mix. Uber uses the [Dymaxion orientation](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) to place the center of each pentagon in the ocean. [Another link](https://t1nak.github.io/blog/2020/h3intro/). And [here is a python script which generates h3 shapefiles in QGIS](https://github.com/maphew/code/blob/master/gis/qgis/h3-in-qgis.md#preparation).
