Additional Verses:

<pre class="lyrics">
I | had a dream the other night, when ev | rything was still; I | thought I saw Susanna dear, a | comin' down the hill,
The | buckweat cake was in her mouth, the | tear was in her eye, Says | I'm coming from the south, Su | sana don't you cry.
Oh! Susanna, | don't you cry for me, I've come | from Alabama with my banjo | on my knee.

I | soon will be in New Orleans, and then | I'll look around; And | when I find Susanna, I'll | fall upon the ground,
But | if I do not find her, this | man will surely die, And | when I'm dead and buried, Su | sana don't you cry.
Oh! Susanna, | don't you cry for me, I've come | from Alabama with my banjo | on my knee.

Oh! Susanna, | don't you cry for me, I've come | from Alabama with my banjo | on my knee.
