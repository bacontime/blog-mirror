From God our heav'nly Father, | A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds | Brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born | The Son of God by name. O
...o ti-dings of com-fort | and joy, comfort and joy. O | o ti-dings of com-fort | and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings | Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a feeding | In tempest storm and wind.
And went to Bethlehem strait-way, | The Son of God to find. O
...o ti-dings of com-fort | and joy, comfort and joy. O | o ti-dings of com-fort | and joy.

The traditional Christmas Carols on this page are all in the Public Domain.
I have based these jianpu renditions on public domain arrangements
from the [Choral Public Domain Library](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
In particular, any arrangements which I have used or modified are licensed under the [CPDL License](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/ChoralWiki:CPDL) or fully in the public domain.

The arrangements on CPDL are often made with four voices, for Soprano/Alto/Tenor/Bass.
I've typically copied the Soprano voice above.
