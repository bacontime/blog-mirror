Consumer Reports [published a story](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/lead-and-cadmium-in-dark-chocolate-a8480295550/) 
about the lead content in some brands of dark chocolate.[^cadmiumnote]
For example, Consumer Reports' testing found that an **single ounce** of Hershey's dark chocolate 
has **2.65 times** California's maximum allowable dose level (MADL) for lead. <!--(0.5 micrograms)-->

[^cadmiumnote]: The article also talks about high levels of cadmium. I have not read the research about cadmium exposure. This post focuses only on lead. But CR's article was so blatantly misleading about lead that I feel comfortable ignoring the concerns about cadmium as well.<!--their fear-mongering about cadmium as well.--> Please let me know if the mentioned levels of Cadmium actually *are* dangerously high.

Oh my goodness! I love eating chocolate. I must be at risk for lead poisoning!

But wait a sec, are those levels actually dangerous?
California is notorious for poorly designed chemical safety regulation.

Short answer:
It's just California being California.
Dark chocolate is safe to eat, thank goodness.

For very small children, occasional chocolate consumption is completely safe.
A diet consisting of literally nothing but dark chocolate
would potentially push the child's lead intake above the limits set by the FDA.
But you probably don't need me to tell you not to give your kid a diet of literally 100% candy.
The risk of lead exposure doesn't even make the top ten list of reasons that's a terrible idea.

And if you're an adult, the detected lead concentrations are so low that it *isn't even worth thinking about*.
You could eat literally nothing but dark chocolate and the lead intake still wouldn't be a concern.


Read on for details.


## Lead Limits in Chocolate

To start off with, what levels of lead in chocolate should be concerning?

Consumer Reports says they chose to use California's MADL because

> there are no federal limits for the amount of lead and cadmium most foods can contain, and CR’s scientists believe that California’s levels are the most protective available.

But this is about as close as you can get to lying without actually saying something technically untrue.
While there may not be federal limits for the amount of lead "most foods" can contain,
the [FDA does have guidelines for the maximum amount of lead in *candy specifically*](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/supporting-document-recommended-maximum-level-lead-candy-likely-be-consumed-frequently-small), 
and the guidelines go into detail about chocolate in particular.

<!--
The [FDA has info about lead in candy](https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/supporting-document-recommended-maximum-level-lead-candy-likely-be-consumed-frequently-small#lead).
See also [this related document](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-lead-candy-likely-be-consumed-frequently-small-children).
-->

The FDA's recommended maximum lead level in candy, including chocolate, is **0.1 parts per million (ppm)**.

### Does Dark Chocolate Stay Below This Limit?

The FDA's article, (which is from 2006) mentions that

> The chocolate industry data indicate that the mean lead level in 226 dark chocolate samples (consisting of 9 products) was 0.048 ppm, the standard deviation was 0.029 ppm, and the maximum lead level found was 0.275 ppm. Several dark chocolate samples had lead levels exceeding 0.1 ppm, and more dark chocolate than milk chocolate samples had lead levels approaching 0.1 ppm.

For comparison, the most lead-contaminated dark chocolate brand in Consumer Report's article was 
*Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate*, with a lead concentration of .047 ppm,[^leadppmcalculation].
This is less than half the limit set by the FDA, and slightly less than the 0.048 ppm average cited by the FDA.

[^leadppmcalculation]: CR states that one ounce of this chocolate has 265% of California's MADL (0.5 micrograms). This means that there are 1.325 micrograms of lead per ounce of chocolate. [Doing the unit conversion](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1.325+micrograms+per+ounce), this works out to 0.047 ppm.

So Consumer Report did not find unusually high levels of lead in chocolate.
There hasn't been any sort of catastrophic contamination event.
The levels of lead measured by CR are pretty much exactly what the relevant regulatory authorities expect to find,
and well below the limits these authorities consider to be dangerous.

These are typical lead levels for chocolate.
If they were dangerously high, the FDA just wouldn't let people sell chocolate.



## But What if I Eat a *LOT* of Chocolate?

Let's consider a worst case scenario for dark-chocolate based lead exposure.
If you eat nothing but the worst brand of dark chocolate, 
would you be consuming a dangerously high amount of lead?

The brand with the highest lead content in Consumer Report's article was
*Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate*.

Looking at the nutrition label on Amazon's storepage, 
one serving of this chocolate weighs 1.45 oz and contains 200 Calories.

10 servings is 2000 Calories, making it a full day's worth of food for the 'typical' person.
That's 14.5 oz of chocolate.

According to Consumer Reports, this brand has 1.325 micrograms of lead per ounce.
So 10 servings would result in your ingesting 19.2 micrograms of lead.

<!--Doublecheck: 41 grams * 10 * 047ppm = 19.27 micrograms-->

Is that a dangerous amount of lead? Probably not if you're an adult. The FDA's provisional total tolerable intake level (PTTIL) for a non-pregnant adult is 75μg/day, well above the 20μg/day you'd get from a nothing-but-dark chocolate diet. The FDA calculates this limit like so: The lowest blood concentration of lead observed to have any measurable health impacts is 30μg lead per deciliter blood. It is estimated that this blood concentration would result from the consumption of 750μg/day of lead, which is divided by 10 to give a safety margin.[^citationforPTTIL]

[^citationforPTTIL]: The FDA's PTTILs for lead come from this paper: Carrington, C. D., & Bolger, P. M. (1992). [An assessment of the hazards of lead in food](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027323009290006U). Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology, 16(3), 265-272.

A nothing-but-dark-chocolate diet is probably a terrible idea for a toddler, however. For small children the PTTIL is only 6μg/day, both because their health is affected by lead in the blood at lower concentrations, and because the same amount of lead consumed translates to a higher blood concentration (baby is small). Even 600 kcal of dark chocolate is enough to push them above that limit, and little kids typically eat above 1000 kcal. There are about a million other reasons that it's a bad idea to feed your kid only candy, but hey, there's another one.

For pregnant women, the PTTIL is 25μg/day. (Baby is sensitive but momma is large.)
The nothing-but-dark-chocolate diet could push the limits of that limit.
But again, that diet would be a bad idea even if chocolate was completely free of impurities.

So what's the important takeaway from all these numbers?

Simple: 
Make sure your kids eat their vegetables,
and don't eat literal kilograms of cocoa powder each day if you are pregnant.

Otherwise, forget about it.



## Some other bits of info


<!--
[This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230017300843#bib7) makes a similar statement.

> A MADL is the exposure level at which a chemical would have no observable reproductive effect, even if a person were exposed to 1000 times that level.

It cites [California legal code](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/regtextart8041511.pdf), but CA code is written atrociously. The linked bit of law mentions

> By means of an assessment that meets the standards described in Section
12803 to determine the maximum dose level having no observable effect, and dividing
that level by one thousand (1,000) to arrive at the maximum allowable dose level,

Remember how the article said:

> CR’s scientists believe that California’s levels are the most protective available

Let me translate that for you:

> CR’s editors believe that California’s levels make for the most provocative infographics

### Actual sources of lead

So if even the worst brand of dark chocolate doesn't contain high enough levels of lead to cause significant concern, 
are there any foods that do?

Probably not. <!-- If there were, they'd be illegal to sell.-->
Or at least, it isn't the food itself that causes the problem.

But there are other ways for a person to consume dangerously high amounts of lead.
I'm sure you've heard of the problems with lead pipes and leaded gasoline,
but did you know we used to use lead solder in food cans until the 90s?

From [this 1993 issue of the Federal Register](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1993-06-21/pdf/FR-1993-06-21.pdf):

> The dietary lead
intake from eating canned foods only
packaged in lead-soldered cans would
be 50 μg/day for 2-year-old children and
75 μg/day for women 25 to 30 years old.

50 micrograms! Remember that 6 is the limit, 
and 10 or so is what they'd get from eating nothing but the worst, 
most contaminated brand of dark chocolate every day.
Fifty! From old cans!

<!--Also worth noting: all these limits don't account for other sources of lead consumption eating into your daily 'budget'. I'm sure you've heard of the leaded gasoline thing, but did you know we used to use lead solder in food cans?!-->


### Where Did the Limits in the Consumer Report Article Come From?

If you're wondering where the California Maximum Allowable Dose Level limit comes from: 
They find the maximum daily exposure level which is known *not* to cause any *reproductive* health problems specifically,
and then divide it by 1000.[^caliMADL]
So the number is basically completely meaningless.

[^caliMADL]: The primary source for this definition seems to be this [this bit of California legal code](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/regtextart8041511.pdf), but it's written obtusely enough that I'm partially relying on [secondary sources like this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230017300843#bib7) for my interpretation. That paper, for example, cites that legal code and describes MADL as "the exposure level at which a chemical would have no observable reproductive effect, even if a person were exposed to 1000 times that level".




<!--But there are ways for food to become contaminated.
But there are-->

<!--
The FDA expends quite a lot of effort testing the levels of contaminants in foodstuffs.
If there were some food that consistently had dangerously high amounts of lead, 
I'd hope the FDA would forbid it from being sold as food.
That is kind of what we're paying them for.
-->
<!--
Also, all these limits don't account for other sources of lead consumption eating into your daily 'budget'. I'm sure you've heard of the leaded gasoline thing, but did you know we used to use lead solder in food cans?!
-->




<!--

While I trust the numbers they give for tested lead concentrations,
the article is misleading when it implies that these levels are dangerously high.



But wait, is that actually dangerous? California is pretty famous for poorly designed chemical safety regulation.

First of all, some other bits of info.

1.325 micrograms per ounce is 0.05 parts per million


This number seems in line with typical averages:

> The chocolate industry data indicate that the mean lead level in 226 dark chocolate samples (consisting of 9 products) was 0.048 ppm, the standard deviation was 0.029 ppm, and the maximum lead level found was 0.275 ppm. Several dark chocolate samples had lead levels exceeding 0.1 ppm, and more dark chocolate than milk chocolate samples had lead levels approaching 0.1 ppm. Dark chocolate samples tended to have higher lead levels than milk chocolate samples because chocolate liquor is the principal source of lead in chocolate products, and dark chocolate products contain higher amounts of chocolate liquor than milk chocolate products.

It also recommends a limit of 0.1 ppm in candy, so the numbers from CR are safe.

> FDA has estimated the potential exposure of small children from the candy products with lead levels no higher than we anticipate to be present in candy produced when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level and has concluded that the lead in such candy products would not constitute a health hazard.

> We used a modeling technique known as Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the mean and 90th percentile daily intake of lead per small child that would likely result if manufactures produced candy with these anticipated lead levels.[9] We then compared these lead intake levels to FDA's provisional total tolerable intake level (PTTIL) for lead by small children of 6 micrograms per day. (Ref. 1) The simulations incorporated data on lead concentration data from FDA's TDS and from industry, and food consumption data from the 1994-98 CSFII.

> The PTTIL is the total daily lead intake from all sources that provides a reasonable margin of protection against the known adverse effects of lead. An estimate of lead intake from a respective type of candy that is low relative to the PTTIL indicates that the candy would not pose a significant risk for adverse health effects from lead exposure.

Ref 1 cites `Federal Register, Vol. 58, pg. 33860, June 21, 1993.`

[This appears to be that document.](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1993-06-21/pdf/FR-1993-06-21.pdf)

> In the proposed rule on ceramic
pitchers (54 FR 23485), FDA announced
a provisional tolerable daily intake
range of 6 to 18 pg/day for lead for a 19-
kilogram (kg) child (22 pounds). As
explained in that proposal, the agency
calculated the lower end of this range
from an EPA health advisory for lead
exposure in the blood. The blood lead
level of concern to EPA was 10 pg/dL
from all sources. FDA calculated the
upper end of the range from the 25 pg/
kg provisional tolerable weekly intake
for lead from all sources established by
the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives pf the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and WHO.

Lots more info starting on page 33863.

To summarize,

- Blood levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter have been observed to cause health problems. This is the Lowest Observed Effect Level (LOEL).
- Eating +1 microgram per day seems to increase blood concentrations of lead by 0.16 mcg/dL in small children.
- Thus an intake of 60 micrograms is the lowest amount known for sure to cause health problems in bebby.
- Divide by ten to get the PTTIL of 6 micrograms per day.

A similar calculation is done to get the 25 microgram PTTIL for pregnant women, ~~based on their body mass.~~
based on a lower conversion ratio.

What about non pregnant adults? 
In non-pregnant adults, the LEOL was 3 times higher, at 30 mcg/dL blood concentration. See below.



> The dietary lead
intake from eating canned foods only
packaged in lead-soldered cans would
be 50 pg/day for 2-year-old children and
75 pg/day for women 25 to 30 years old.
Thus, the use of only lead-soldered food
cans would result in a 5-fold increase in
the dietary lead intake for children and
women 25 to 30 years old from
consumption of canned foods.

[This page](https://dradrianmd.com/prop-65) mentions

> For example, for lead, for children under the age of six, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has established the “provisional total tolerable intake level” at six micrograms of lead per day.  Consuming less than this amount of lead daily is an amount the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deems to be safe for children in this age group.  By contrast, Proposition 65 requires a warning notice on any product that provides 0.5 micrograms of lead daily – an amount 12 times lower than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s “provisional total tolerable intake level” for daily lead consumption in a six-year-old.  For pregnant women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s “provisional total tolerable intake level” for lead is 25 micrograms daily, which is 50 times greater than the amount requiring a Proposition 65 warning notice.  Finally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s “provisional total tolerable intake level” for non-pregnant adults is set at 75 micrograms of lead daily, which is 150 times greater than the amount requiring a Proposition 65 warning notice in the State of California.

No cite, sadly.

But taking that as given, How much Hershey's dark chocolate (1.325 micrograms lead per oz) would you need to exceed the limit of PTTIL?
For small children, it's 4.52 oz.
For pregnant women, it's 18.9 oz.
For non-pregnant adults, it's 56.6 oz.
(cites [this source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1293643/))

Nutrition facts for HERSHEY'S SPECIAL DARK Mildly Sweet Chocolate say one serving is 200 kcal, 1.45oz.
This means 138 kcal per oz. 
You would need to eat 14.5 oz to get 2000 kcal.
So a day's worth of chocolate is 19.2 micrograms. Under the limit for even pregnant women. Great!
But if a six year old eating, say, 1400 kcal, then that's 13.4 micrograms lead. That's too much.

[Okay, this page cites some sources thank goodness.](https://www.michaelmooney.net/Lead_In_Vitamins.pdf)

> According to the World Health Organization’s safety data on lead, the Provisional Tolerable Weekly
Intake (PTWI) for ingestion of lead from all sources is 25 mcg per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of bodyweight. 3
(The PTWI is a dosage that is known to be safe over time, because over time it is well-known by
scientists that the body is exposed to and excretes a certain amount of lead easily.)
To simplify this equation into terms we can understand, the PTWI safe weekly intake of lead for a 150-
pound person (150 lbs = 68.18 kilograms) times 25 mcg is 1704 mcg of lead per week or 243 mcg of
lead per day.

<!----

Okay back to that cite which contained the numbers for FDA's recommendations:

[An assessment of the hazards of lead in food](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1293643/)

Oh, this is from the FDA, so it's official.

> current dietary
intakes of lead in various age groups have been estimated to range from 5 to 11 pg
Pb/day (Bolger et al., 1991).

> Any decision to limit exposure to
lead from a particular source must consider the addition of that particular source to
exposure from other nondietary and dietary sources. The provisional tolerable total
intake levels do not account for exposures to lead that may be expected to occur from
other sources. Therefore, these numbers will need to be adjusted downward to allow
for other anticipated exposures to lead. Table 4 provides examples of levels that might
be selected for an individual dietary source.

It looks like these are determined by finding the lowest level shown to cause problems, and dividing it by ten.


> Adults. Levels of 30 pg Pb/dl have been repeatedly associated with [bad stuff]

> The relationship between lead ingestion and
blood lead levels in children and adults has been estimated to be 0.16 and 0.04 mcg/dL blood lead per mcg ingested per day.


So to reiterate:
- LOEL 10 in blood for bebby (or pregante), 30 in grownup.
- When finding out how much eaten results in this amount, multiply by 6 for bebby, 25 for grownup
- divide by 10 for safety margin.

What about WHO's limits?

[This page](https://chempedia.info/page/092062239246072222102248074067140070044040024071/) suggests WHO's limit is 500 micrograms per day.

[This](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/123077/AQG2ndEd_6_7Lead.pdf) talks a lot about exposure, but doesn't recommend limits. Curiously, it also claims that 

> Several studies have
reported average lead intakes in the range of 100–500 μg/day for adults, with individual diets
covering a much greater range. More recent data indicate total daily intakes of about 100 μg
or less (12).

It's from 2001, so maybe things have just rapidly improved.

[This page](https://inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v21je16.htm) also mentions the WHO limit of provisional tolerable weekly intake
of 3 mg of lead/person, equivalent to 0.05 mg/kg b.w. for adults. (3 mg is 3000 micrograms,)

> Mahaffey recommended that the
    maximum tolerable intake for lead from all sources for infants between
    birth and age 6 months should be as low as possible and less than
    100 µg/day, and that intake should be no more than 150 µg of lead/day
    for children between 6 months and 2 years (Mahaffey, 1977).

>  In a study with infants Ryu et al. (1983) demonstrated that
    with low non-dietary exposure to lead, a mean intake of 3-4 µg
    lead/kg b.w. was not associated with an increase in blood lead
    concentration. However, increased blood lead levels did occur when the
    dietary intakes of lead were 8-9 µg/kg b.w./day.

Overall, a very info-rich page!

https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/law/proposition-65-law-and-regulations


[This page](https://dradrianmd.com/prop-65) is well written but lacks sources.

> The maximum daily exposure threshold for a birth defect-risk chemical is determined using the “no observable effect level.”  The “no observable effect level” is defined as the maximum daily level of exposure that has been shown to not cause any birth defects or reproductive harm in laboratory animals or humans.  In addition, as a margin of safety, the “no observable effect level” is divided by 1,000 to establish the threshold for requiring a Proposition 65 warning notice for that chemical.

also says

> The maximum daily exposure threshold for a cancer-risk chemical is determined using the “no significant risk level.” The “no significant risk level” is defined as the maximum daily level of exposure that would result in not more than one additional case of cancer in 100,000 individuals exposed to that specific chemical every day for 70 years.  In other words, a person who was exposed for 70 years to the maximum daily limit of the chemical at the “no significant risk level” would have no more than a one-in-100,000 chance of developing cancer as a result of that 70-year exposure.

[This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230017300843#bib7) makes a similar statement.

> A MADL is the exposure level at which a chemical would have no observable reproductive effect, even if a person were exposed to 1000 times that level.

It cites [California legal code](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/regtextart8041511.pdf), but CA code is written atrociously. The linked bit of law mentions

> By means of an assessment that meets the standards described in Section
12803 to determine the maximum dose level having no observable effect, and dividing
that level by one thousand (1,000) to arrive at the maximum allowable dose level,

But how do I find section 12803. I haven't a clue. A web search finds plenty of CA laws with that section header, and I didn't see any related to chemical safety testing.

Fortunately, it also then defines

> For purposes of this article, “NOEL” shall mean that no observable effect
level, which is the maximum dose level of exposure at which a chemical has no
observable reproductive effect.

So I'll just have to accept that wording is the best I'm going to get.


[Here's a big table of CA limits](https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/general-info/current-proposition-65-no-significant-risk-levels-nsrls-maximum).

-----------

So, the lead in the dark chocolate. You still probably shouldn't eat *only* cocoa powder, but even a diet of nothing but dark chocolate would keep you under the 

So, the lead in the dark chocolate.

The highest lead concentration in chocolate found by Consumer Reports was 1.33 µg/oz, found in Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate.
This brand of chocolate has 200 kcal in a 1.45 oz serving. 
You would need to eat 14.5 oz to get the 'typical' 2000 kcal of energy,
would you result in your ingesting 19.2 micrograms of lead.

Is that a dangerous amount of lead? Probably not if you're an adult.
The FDA's provisional total tolerable intake level (PTTIL) for a non-pregnant adult is 75μg/day,
well above the 20μg/day you'd get from a nothing-but-dark chocolate diet.
The FDA calculates this limit like so: The lowest blood concentration of lead observed to have any measurable health impacts is 30μg lead per deciLiter blood. It is estimated that this blood concentration would result from the consumption of 750μg/day of lead, which is divided by 10 to give a safety margin.

A nothing-but-dark-chocolate diet is probably a terrible idea for a toddler, however.
For small children the PTTIL is only 6μg/day, both because their health is affected by lead in the blood at lower concentrations, and because the same amount of lead consumed translates to a higher blood concentration (bebby is smol).
Even 600 kcal of dark chocolate is enough to push them above that limit, and little kids typically eat above 1000 kcal.

There are about a million other reasons that it's a bad idea to feed your kid *only* candy, but hey, there's another one.

Also, all these limits don't account for other sources of lead consumption eating into your daily 'budget'. I'm sure you've heard of the leaded gasoline thing, but did you know we used to use lead solder in food cans?!


https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1993-06-21/pdf/FR-1993-06-21.pdf


> The dietary lead
intake from eating canned foods only
packaged in lead-soldered cans would
be 50 μg/day for 2-year-old children and

Finally, where does the California maximum allowable dose level limit come from? They find the maximum daily exposure level which is known *not* to cause any *reproductive* health problems specifically, and then divide it by 1000. So the number is basically completely meaningless.
