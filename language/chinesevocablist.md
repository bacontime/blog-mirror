<!--
This is a collection of vocabulary lists I've put together. 
The only common factor is that I found these collections of words compelling or interesting in some way.

Translations come mostly from [MDBG](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) and conversations with my wife.

## Translations of Minimal English

I wanted to find list of words that would let me discuss concepts without knowing the specific word for that concept.

[Minimal English](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage/what-is-nsm) is an attempt to compile a set of words and grammar which are in some sense maximally translatable. The idea then is that the core translation can be used to define more complex terms. 
The examples of basic translation they give are rather awkward and stilted. But I can admire the project as an art piece, and the set of words they came up with is conceptually close to what I was looking for.


### Semantic Primes

*Semantic Primes* are what the authors of Minimal English call a set of concepts which:
 - Everyone in the world understands, and
 - which are difficult or even impossible to define in more simple terms. 
 
 How do you define "Me"? You point at yourself while saying it. 
 
The author's of Minimal English provided [a translation list of these terms into Chinese](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/word_doc/0032/345992/Chinese_Table_Primes_Final_YE_07_11_2016.docx), and the list below is based on the linked list, but with some slight differences, edits, and additional clarifications.
 
 
| English | Chinese | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| I | 我 (wŏ) |  |
| you | 你 (nĭ) | Or 您 (nín) if you want to be extra formal. |
| someone | 某人mŏurén or 有人yŏurén or 人rén | 有些人 (yǒuxiērén) means 'some people' |
| somethingorthing | 什么shénme or 某事 mŏshì or 东西dōngxī | 什么 also means 'what'. '东西' literally means 'eastwest' and can be used similarly to 'dingus' or 'whatzit'. |
| people | 人们 (rénmen) | 们 is also used as the plural modifier for pronouns. |
| body | 身体 (shēntĭ) |  |
| kinds | 种类 (zhŏnglèi) | varieties, categories, etc. |

| much, many | 很多 (hĕnduō) or 许多 (xŭduō) | 很多 is literally 'very more'. |
| little, few | 很少 (hěnshǎo) or 一点点 (yīdiǎndiǎn) | Dictionaries also list the word as "一点", with only one diǎn. But my wife says the typical idom has two diǎns. See for example, [the title of this song by Jay Chou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COhiu3c7Sgc). |
| good | 好 (hăo) |  |

| think | 觉得 (juéde) 认为 (rènwéi) |  |

| don't want | 不要 (bùyào) |  |

| happen | 发生 (fāshēng) |  |
| move | 动 (dòng) |  |
| be (somewhere) | 在 (zài) | Saying the object is at some place or engaged in some activity. Eg: "他在家" ("He is home."), "他在拉屎" ("He is pooping"). Compare to Spanish "estar". |
| be (something) | 是(shì) | Saying two things are the same or that the object belongs to a category. "He is a doctor." Compare to Spanish "ser". For some qualities like 'tall' or 'sick', use 很 (hěn) instead. |

| mine | 我的 (wǒde) | Example: "这 东西 是 我的" ("This thingamajig is mine."). "的" can be appended to a noun to indicate possession: 你的 (yours), 某人的 (somebody's), &c. |
| live, alive | 生活 (shēnghuó) or 活(huó) or 活着(huózhe) |  |

| for some time | 一段时间 (yīduàn shíjiān)  |  |
| moment | 一刻 (yīkè) or 时刻 (shíkè) |  |
| place where| 地方 (dìfāng) or 哪里 (nǎlǐ) | 地方 is a place, as in a 'region' or 'location'; the characters 地方 can be incorrectly translated as 'soil rectangle'. as in "你在哪里？" ("Where are you?", literally "You are where?). Not to be confused with the similar 那里 (nàli), meaning 'there' or 'that place'. |
| here| 这里 (zhèlǐ) |  |
| above | 上面 (shàngmiàn) or 上 (shàng) |  |
| below | 下面 (xiàmiàn) or 下 (xià) |  |
| far | 远 (yuăn) |  |

| side | 边 (biān) | 边 means 'not in the middle', 'edge', 'side', &c.  |
| inside | 里面 (lĭmiàn) | 外面 (wàimiàn) for 'outside'. |
| touch | 接触 (jiēchù) or 触摸 (chùmō) | The difference between 接触 and 触摸 is somewhat like the difference between 'contact' and 'poke'. |
| not | 不 (bù) or 没 (méi) | 不 is negation. 没 means a lack, typically used before 有, as in "我没有水" ("I don't have water"). These words can also be used to inquire ask questions like so: 好不好 ("How's it hangin'?"", literally "good not good"), 有没有... ("Is there any ...", literally "have not have"). |

The authors  of Minimal English say the following conjuctions aren't universal, but the this seems like a good place to include them:

| English | Chinese |
|---|---|
| and | 和 (hé) |
| but | 但是 (dànshì) |
| or | 或 (huò) |



### So-called Universal Semantic Molecules

The Authors of Minimal English provide the following list of more complicated concepts which they claim are nonetheless universal to all languages.

| hands | 手 (shǒu) |  |
| mouth | 口 (kǒu) |  |
| eyes | 目 (mù) |  |
| head | 头 (tóu) | 头 has an oddly similar set of meanings to the English 'head'. There's the body part. But 头 can also mean boss, leader, top, beginning. And 头 is the measure word for livestock, in the same way that English has the phrase "head of cattle": "三头牛" means "three head of cattle". (In Chinese, you would also say 三头猪, whereas English would just say "three pigs" instead of "three head of pig".) |
| ears | 耳 (ěr) |  |

### Other Words from the Same Source

In addition to the above universal terms, the authors of Minimal English also provide a list of terms which they believe to be useful for international communication. And hey, I may as well learn those words too.
