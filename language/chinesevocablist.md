# My Lists of Terms for Learning in Mandarin

This is a collection of vocabulary lists I've put together. 
The only common factor is that I found these collections of words compelling or interesting in some way.

Translations come mostly from [MDBG](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) and conversations with my wife.

## Translations of Minimal English

I wanted to find list of words that would let me discuss concepts without knowing the specific word for that concept.

[Minimal English](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage/what-is-nsm) is an attempt to compile a set of words and grammar which are in some sense maximally translatable. The idea then is that the core translation can be used to define more complex terms. 
The examples of basic translation they give are rather awkward and stilted. But I can admire the project as an art piece, and the set of words they came up with is conceptually close to what I was looking for.


### Semantic Primes

*Semantic Primes* are what the authors of Minimal English call a set of concepts which:
 - Everyone in the world understands, and
 - which are difficult or even impossible to define in more simple terms. 
 
 How do you define "Me"? You point at yourself while saying it. 
 
The author's of Minimal English provided [a translation list of these terms into Chinese](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/word_doc/0032/345992/Chinese_Table_Primes_Final_YE_07_11_2016.docx), and the list below is based on the linked list, but with some slight differences, edits, and additional clarifications.

| little, few | 很少 (hěnshǎo) or 一点点 (yīdiǎndiǎn) | Dictionaries also list the word as "一点", with only one diǎn. But my wife says the typical idom has two diǎns. See for example, [the title of this song by Jay Chou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COhiu3c7Sgc). |

| be (something) | 是(shì) | Saying two things are the same or that the object belongs to a category. "He is a doctor." Compare to Spanish "ser". For some qualities like 'tall' or 'sick', use 很 (hěn) instead. |

| moment | 一刻 (yīkè) or 时刻 (shíkè) |  |

| English | Chinese |
|---|---|
| and | 和 (hé) |
| but | 但是 (dànshì) |
| or | 或 (huò) |



### So-called Universal Semantic Molecules

The Authors of Minimal English provide the following list of more complicated concepts which they claim are nonetheless universal to all languages.

| eyes | 目 (mù) |  |
| head | 头 (tóu) | 头 has an oddly similar set of meanings to the English 'head'. There's the body part. But 头 can also mean boss, leader, top, beginning. And 头 is the measure word for livestock, in the same way that English has the phrase "head of cattle": "三头牛" means "three head of cattle". (In Chinese, you would also say 三头猪, whereas English would just say "three pigs" instead of "three head of pig".) |

### Other Words from the Same Source

In addition to the above universal terms, the authors of Minimal English also provide a list of terms which they believe to be useful for international communication. And hey, I may as well learn those words too.
