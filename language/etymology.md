Regression (statistics)
: Francis Galton was studying how tall people tend to have children shorter than they are. Their descendants' heights 'regress'. From this was coined the term *regression to the mean*, and from there 'regression' grew to refer to any of a broad array of techniques for studying the relationships between variables.


Capital and per-capita
: Both derive from the latin *capita*, meaning *head*. 'Per-capita' refers to human heads, of course. While 'Capital' refers to heads of cattle, which would now be classified as a specific kind of capital, falling under the category of [cultivated biological resources](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6380).



Alphabet
: It means 'barn', in a roundabout way. "Alphabet" comes from "alpha beta" (AB), the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, which in turn comes from "aleph beth" (𐤁𐤀), the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet. "Aleph" also meant "cattle", and "beth" also meant "house". It is thought that the the forms of the letters are simplified representations of Egyptian hieroglyphs for the same (𓃾 𓉐). So "alphabet" descends from "cattle house", a *barn*.

Tycoon
: From the Japanese 大君 (taikun), a title used for the shogun which literally translates to "big boss". After Commodore Perry made contact with the US, the word was [used as a nickname for Abraham Lincoln](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/14/232119964/the-history-of-how-a-shoguns-boast-made-lincoln-a-tycoon).

Doctor
: [From a Latin word meaning 'teacher'](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-history-of-doctor). IE, a Doctorate is a certificate saying you know enough about a field to teach it. Nowadays, the word is most commonly used as short for "medical doctor", which [can lead to confusion]({{ "/language/lord.html" | relative_url }}).

Lord
: "Lord" means "bread guardian". It's a contraction of "loaf ward", or rather the Old English *hlafweard*.

Companion
: From *com-panis*, meaning 'together-bread'. A companion is someone you share bread with. 


Soup
: Originally refering to *suppa*, the bread soaked in broth.

Stew
: Originally meaning a steam bath.

Salad
: From vulgar latin *salata*, meaning *salted*. Short for *herba salata*, meaning salted herbs. A pile of gherkins? Totally a salad.

Patient
: Nowadays refers to the ability to wait, or to someone who is sick. Originally meant the ability to endure suffering.
