# Chinese Characters

Hanzi, or Chinese characters, are the logographic symbols used to write Chinese. 
These characters also play a large role in several other languages.

Logograms[^logogrammeaning] are symbols which represent *words*, as opposed to phonograms[^phonogrammeaning] (like the ones you are currently looking at), which are symbols that represent *sounds*.

I'm generally terrible at language acquisition, but I find Chinese characters compelling to study for two main reasons:

- Firstly, my wife's first language is Chinese, and writes personal notes in her native language. I'm at the point where I can *mostly* read a grocery list, but not anywhere close to being able to read her journal entries. 
- Secondly, I'm fascinated by ideograms[^ideogramnote] in general. Numerals, mathematical operators, emojis, bathroom signs, and astronomical symbols. All of these convey meaning without explicitly representing sound: 28 ∯∫ ❤︎☺ 🚺🚹 ☾🜨

In the links down below, you can find several lists of Chinese characters that I've compiled for my own study and amusement.

[^logogrammeaning]: "Logogram" comes from λόγος (word) + γράμμα (letter)

[^phonogrammeaning]: "Phonogram" comes from φωνή (voice) + γράμμα (letter)

[^ideogramnote]: An "ideogram" is a symbol representing an idea. Some sources seem to use the word as a synonym for "logogram"; others angrily insist that the two are distinct. What's the distinction between "logogram" and "ideogram"? It seems to depend on which linguist is doing the complaining.
