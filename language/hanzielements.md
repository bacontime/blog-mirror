# Hanzi for the Chemical Elements

Only a few pure chemical elements were known to people in ancient times. 
Then starting in the late 1700s, there was an explosion of chemical discoveries.
These new elements required a bevy of new names, 
and many of these elements were named after people or places involved in their discovery.

Peter van de Krogt has [a wonderful website with details about the origins of each element's English and international names](https://elements.vanderkrogt.net/index.php).

But in the 1800s, when people set out to translate such discoveries for global audiences, they found that translating the names of these new elements into Chinese required additional care.

Some early attempts involved direct transliteration, so that a word like "Magnesium" might be translated as "美合尼西恩" ("Měihéníxīēn"), which is a sequence of five characters which by themselves mean: beautiful, together, female monk, west, and favor. That kind of phonetic pileup might work fine for a proper noun (looking at you, "施瓦辛格"), but it looks silly and confusing when placed alongside svelte classically-known element names like "金" and "汞".

The approach settled on by [Xu Shou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E5%BE%90%E5%A3%BD) and [John Fryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fryer_(sinologist)) was to choose a singular character for each element. 
In those cases where there wasn't already a widely-used character for an element, the pair invented a new one. 
The vast majority of these invented characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that one component of the character indicates that it is a chemical element, 
while the other part of the character gives a hint about the pronunciation of the element's name. 
This approach eventually became the standard one, and has been used as recently as 2017 to coin Chinese terms for newly-synthesized elements.

The semantic radicals used are 石 (stone), 钅or 金 (metal), and 气 (gas). Bromine uses 氵(water), and mercury uses 水 (also water).




Back then, there wasn't a standardized system for transliterating between the latin alphabet and Chinese characters. 
As such, translators had to choose between inventing new characters or fully transliterating elements names via an unwieldy chain of near-homophones (eg using "美合尼西恩" to Měihé ní xī ēn).

## List of Element Names in Mainland Mandarin Chinese

In the "Radicals" column, I've pasted the sort-of component sub-characters on their own.
In the "Literal" column, I've written a literal translation of these component characters.
But remember that these typically aren't the actual etymology of these words; their homophonic mnemonics in Mandarin.

氜氜rì日




H (Hydrogen) = 氢/氫 (qīng)
: Modern term. Homophonic with 轻/輕, meaning 'lightweight'.
: Short for 轻气/氢气 (qīngqì), lightweight gas.
: Another early translation of hydrogen into Chinese was 水母气 (shuǐmǔqì), where 水 means 'water' and 母 means 'mother'. It's clear that the translator intended this to be a literal translation of the term (hydro-gen = water-producer), but 水母 means 'jellyfish', so it's a rather awkward translation.

He (Helium) = 氦 (hài)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 亥, meaning 'astrological pig'.

Li (Lithium) = 锂/鋰 (lǐ)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 里, meaning 'village'.

Be (Beryllium) = 铍/鈹 (pí)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 皮, meaning 'feather'.

B (Boron) = 硼 (péng)
: Classic term. Homophonic with 朋, meaning 'friend'.
: Originally used to mean borax, 硼砂 (péngshā).

C (Carbon) = 碳 (tàn)
: Classic term. Modified version of 炭 (tàn), meaning coal.

N (Nitrogen) = 氮 (dàn)
: Modern term. Homophonic with 淡, meaning 'bland' or 'dilute'.
: Short for 淡气 (dànqì).
: 淡 is composed of one 氵water radical  and two 火 fire radicals. Confusingly, the character for nitrogen drops the water radical, making '氮' appear to be composed of '炎气' (yánqì), where 炎 means 'blazing hot' or 'inflammation', neither of which makes sense to describe nitrogen.
: Another early translation of nitrogen was 硝气 (xiāoqì), where 硝 means 'niter'.

O (Oxygen) = 氧 (yǎng)
: Modern term. Homophonic with 养, meaning 'life-nurturing'.
: Short for 养气 (yǎngqì). The phrase '养气' is still in use nowadays, but typically in a more spiritual sense; 气 (qì) can also refer to the traditional notion of life energy, and so 养气 is basically self-care.
: The character 氧 actually contains '羊' (yáng), meaning 'goat'. This substitution is easier to write, and works on multiple levels. 羊 and 养 look similar, they're pronounced similarly, and goats 羊 happen to be an example of the lifeforms which are nourished 养 by oxygen.

F (Fluorine) = 氟 (fú)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 弗, meaning 'negative'.

Ne (Neon) = 氖 (nǎi)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 乃, meaning 'indeed'.

Na (Sodium) = 钠/鈉 (nà)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 纳, meaning 'offer'.

Mg (Magnesium) = 镁/鎂 (měi)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 美, meaning 'beautiful'.

Al (Aluminium) = 铝/鋁 (lǚ)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 吕, meaning 'Lu' (it's a surname).
: 吕 can also refer to a musical note in a very old system of tones.
: Other early translations include: 矾精 (fánjīng), meaning 'alum essence'; 钒 (fán), which could be interpreted as 'alum metal', but which is now used as the symbol for vanadium; and the transliteration 哀卢弥尼恩 (āilúmíníēn).

Si (Silicon) = 硅 (guī)
: Modern term. Homophonic with 圭, which refers to a special piece of jade.
: Other early attempts to translate 'silicon' included: 玻精 (bōjīng), meaning 'glass essence'; 矽 (xī), homophone of 夕, meaning 'dusk'; and the very silly full transliteration '夕里西恩 (xīlǐxīēn)'.
: 矽 is still used by some, but is homophonic with 硒, which means selenium.

P (Phosphorus) = 磷 (lín)
: Classic term for phosphorus. Modified version of 燐 or 粦 (same pronunciation).
: The origin of the character 粦 is likely related to the phenomenon of ghost flame, will-o'-the-wisp, which is sometimes produced when decaying organic matter releases phosphine gas.

S (Sulfur) = 硫 (liú)
: Classic term for sulfur.
: Homophonic with 旒, meaning 'tassel'.
: 㐬 itself can be interpreted as an alternate version of 荒 (huāng), meaning 'wasteland'.

Cl (Chlorine) = 氯 (lǜ)
: Modern term. Homophonic with 绿, meaning 'green'.
: Short for 绿气 (lǜqì).
: Same origin as 'chlorine', which comes from χλωρός, an ancient greek term for the color.

Ar (Argon) = 氩/氬 (yà)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 亚/亞, meaning 'next'.
: 亚 is also used as a symbol for the continent of Asia.

K (Potassium) = 钾/鉀 (jiǎ)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 甲, meaning 'shell', among other things.
: How does one get 'jiǎ' from 'potassium'? It's actually a transliteration from the latin name for the element, 'kalium'.
: Okay then. How  does one get 'jiǎ' from 'kalium'? I couldn't find a definitive source, but I suspect the reason lies in the same dialect variations that led early translators to write 北京 as 'Peking' instead of  'Běijīng'.
: Other early translations or potassium: 灰精 (huījīng), meaning 'ash essence'; or a full transliteration 卜对斯恩 (bǔduìsīēn).

Ca (Calcium) = 钙/鈣 (gài)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 丐, meaning 'beggar'.

Sc (Scandium) = 钪/鈧 (kàng)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 亢, meaning 'proud'.

Ti (Titanium) = 钛/鈦 (tài)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 太, meaning 'very big'.

V (Vanadium) = 钒/釩 (fán)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 凡, meaning 'mundane'.

Cr (Chromium) = 铬/鉻 (gè)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 各, meaning 'each'.

: Loanword. Homophonic with 猛, meaning 'ferocious'.

Fe (Iron) = 铁/鐵 (tiě)

: The traditional character has a radical resembling 戜 (dié), meaning 'scrape'. the simplified character has a radical resembling 失 (shī), meaning 'miss' or 'misplace'.

Co (Cobalt) = 钴/鈷 (gǔ)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 古, meaning 'ancient'.

Ni (Nickel) = 镍/鎳 (niè)

: Loanword. Homophonic with 告, meaning 'sue'.

Nb (Niobium) = 铌/鈮 (ní)

In (Indium) = 铟/銦 (yīn)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 因, meaning 'because of'.

Sn (Tin) = 锡/錫 (xī)
: Classic term for tin.
: By itself, 易 (yì) means 'change', as in the title of the ancient divination manual, the 易經 *Yi Jing*, the *Book of Changes.*.

Sb (Antimony) = 锑/銻 (tī)
: Loanword. Sounds similar to 弟 (dì/tì), meaning 'little brother'/'brotherly respect'.
: When pronounced tì, 弟 is short for 悌.
: Some dictionaries online give tì as an alternate pronunciation for 锑, making it an exact homophone.

Te (Tellurium) = 碲 (dì)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 帝, meaning 'god emperor'.

I (Iodine) = 碘 (diǎn)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 典, meaning 'classic'.

: Loanword. Homophonic with 有, meaning 'have'.

Gd (Gadolinium) = 钆/釓 (gá)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 轧, meaning 'grind' or 'squeeze together'.
: The initial version of the character had the full 轧 as a radical instead of only 乚, but that was too complex.

Tb (Terbium) = 铽/鋱 (tè)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 忒, meaning 'excessive'.

Dy (Dysprosium) = 镝/鏑 (dī)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 滴, meaning 'drip'.

: Loanword.
: By itself, 我 (wǒ) is the first person pronoun.
: 锇 is homophonic with 鹅, meaning 'goose'. 
: Other homophones with the same radical: 哦, which can be pronounced ó as an interjection or é to mean 'chant'; and 俄, meaning 'suddenly' or short for 俄罗斯 (Éluósī), meaning 'Russia'.

Ir (Iridium) = 铱/銥 (yī)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 衣, meaning 'clothing'.

Pt (Platinum) = 铂/鉑 (bó)
: Repurposed character. 铂 used to mean gold foil. 
: In every day language, platinum is colloquially called 白金/铂金  (báijīn/bójīn), literally meaning 'white gold' or 'white metal'.
: Compare this to the etymology of 'platinum', which means 'little silver'. Similarly, the alchemical symbol for platinum was simply a combination of the symbols for gold and silver.

Au (Gold) = 金 (jīn)
: Classic term for gold, money, and metal in general. 
: In very ancient times, it was a symbol for copper or its alloys.

Hg (Mercury) = 汞 (gǒng)
: Classic term for mercury. Homophonic with 工, meaning 'labor'.
: In everyday speech, mercury is more commonly called 水银 (shuǐyín), meaning 'water silver', akin to how it is called 'quicksilver' in English or 'hydrargyrum' in latin.
: The *planet* Mercury is called 水星 (Shuǐxīng), 'water planet', and it feels likely to me that the convergent names are both in reference to the planet's speed.
: Several interesting linguistic coincidences here.

Tl (Thallium) = 铊/鉈 (tā)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 它, meaning 'it'.

Pb (Lead) = 铅/鉛 (qiān)
: Classic term for lead.
: By itself, 㕣 yǎn is an old term for a marshy valley.
: The character 铅 can also be pronouced yán when used as a proper noun.

Bi (Bismuth) = 铋/鉍 (bì)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 必, meaning 'necessarily'.

Po (Polonium) = 钋/釙 (pō)
: Loanword. I'm unsure of the etymology.
: By itself, 卜 (bǔ) refers to divination. It is also used in 萝卜 (luóbo), meaning 'radish'. I had an inlaw call me 萝卜 as a nickname because it sounds similar to 'Robert'.
: Although 卜 is pronounced differently, I'm guessing it was just a standard character used for transliterating the 'po' sound, at least among the people that came up with these element translations. 'Potassium' was initially transliterated as '卜对斯恩', for example. Looking at other transliterations, however, it seems more common to use 波 (bō), as in 波兰 (Bōlán), meaning Poland.

At (Astatine) = 砹 (ài)
: Loanword. Homophonic with 艾, meaning 'mugwort'.

: Loanword. Homophonic with 局, meaning 'narrow'.

: Loanword. Homophonic with 赔, meaning 'idemnify' or 陪, meaning 'accompany'.
: Berkely, the namesake of Berkelium is commonly transliterated as 伯克利 (Bókèlì).
: The mainland uses 锫, but in Taiwan, it is more common to use 鉳 (běi), which is homophonic to 北, meaning 'north'.

Regarding the names of metal elements, “鈹” (bi, beryl-
lium), “鈧” (kang, scandium), “鈦” (tai, titanium), “銠”
(lao, rhodium), “銫” (se, cesium), “鉭” (tan, tantalum), and
“銪” (you, europium) were chosen because “they have fewer
strokes” and easier to write.

the word for Rutherfordium might also be an alternative from of the term for stove?


In some cases, the simplified character isn't available.

antimony? 厗


费 expenditure is 弗 negative 贝 money

[^ancientname]: This element's name has been in use for a very long time, though the modern character may have been changed for the sake of standardization or simplification. 

[^hydrogennote]: "轻" decomposes to "车𢀖". "车" means cart. By itself, "𢀖" doesn't really have any meaning. Another early translation of "hydrogen" into Chinese was "水母气" (shuǐmǔqì), where "水" means 'water' and "母" means 'mother'. It's clear that the translator intended this to be a literal translation of the term (hydro-gen = water-producer), but "水母" means 'jellyfish', so it's a rather awkward translation.

[^oxygennote]: "Oxygen" was initially translated into Chinese as "养气" (yǎngqì), where "养" means helping something grow. However, the character for oxygen, "氧" (yǎng), actually decomposes to "羊气" (yángqì), where "羊" means 'goat'. This substitution works well on multiple levels - because "yǎng" and "yáng" are near homophones, because "养" appears to contain the character "羊" as a sub-component, and because animal life is dependent on abundant oxygen. The phrase "养气" itself is still in use nowadays, but in a more spiritual sense; "气" (qì) can also refer to the traditional notion of life energy, and so 养气 is basically self-care.

[^nitrogennote]: "Nitrogen" was translated in Chinese as "淡气" (dànqì), where "淡" means 'bland' or 'dilute' and is composed of one 氵water radical  and two 火 fire radicals. Confusingly, the character for nitrogen drops the water radical, making "氮" appear to be composed of "炎气" (yánqì), where 炎 means 'blazing hot' or 'inflammation', neither of which makes sense to describe nitrogen. Another old translation of "Nitrogen" was "硝气" (xiāoqì), where "硝" means 'niter'. Niter is also the source of the word "nitrogen", so "硝气" was a more direct translation. 

[^chlorinenote]: Chlorine uses 录 (lù) (copy) instead of the full 绿 (lǜ) (green)

Thanks, Baidu.

a lot of the component characters are archaic or have multiple meanings. 

For example, 申 can be used to mean statement or description, or it can be used as an old name for Shanghai, or it can be used to refer to the 9th Earthly Branch, which is a classical name for the seventh month or the time from 3pm to 5pm.

Li (unit): ideogrammatic compound

目 is also a unit of measurement?

得 cowry shell variant thing.



因 man on matress, tradition

gadolinium 钆 is ga2. 乚 is ya or yi or hao.
轧 is ga2: crush together

镝 di is also used to refer to arrowhead (different tone though)

“水母氣" means water-mother-gas. One of the chinese sources mentioned that one as a translation error.

A NEW INQUIRY INTO THE TRANSLATION OF
CHEMICAL TERMS BY JOHN FRYER AND XU SHOU
http://www.wsc.uni-erlangen.de/pdf/wang.pdf



Ministry of Education and the Institute co-estab-
lished a commission to review chemical terms with Zheng
being the Chief Commissioner. They published the Princi-
ples of Chemical Nomenclature (化學命名原則) in 1933.
Standardized terms.

Among them, masurium (atomic
number 43) and illinium (atomic number 61) were proven to
have been misidentified and then repealed. Only three new
names “鉿” (ha, hafnium), “釙” (po, polonium), “錸” (lai,
rhenium) have been created.

The Revised Principles of Chemical Nomenclature, pub-
lished in 1945, only changed three elements’ names. The
changes include from “ ” to “氡” (dong, radon), from
“ ” to “釓” (ga, gadolinium), and from “鈳” to “鈮” (ni,
niobium)

 On the other hand, we really
had to appreciate Anatole Billequin’s unmatched contribu-
tion to create following 42 names meaningfully: “ ” (alu-
minum), “ ” (antimony), “ ” (arsenic), “ ” (barium),
“鉗” (beryllium), “ ” (bismuth), “ ” (bromine), “ ”
(cadmium), “ ” (cesium), “ ” (calcium), “ ” (cerium),
“ ” (chromium), “錆” (cobalt), “ ” (determined a non-
element afterwards), “ ” (fluorine), “ ” (indium), “ ”
(iodine), “ ” (iridium), “ ” (lanthanum), “鉐” (lithium),
“ ” (magnesium), “ ” (manganese), “ ” (molybde-
num), “ ” (nickel), “ ” (niobium), “ ” (potassium), “
鐚” (osmium), “硄” (phosphorous), “ ” (rhodium), “
” (rubidium), “ ” (ruthenium), ” (selenium), “ ”
(sodium), “ ” (strontium), “ ” (tellurium), “ ” (thal-
lium), “鐳” (thorium, the word “鐳” is now used by radium),
“ ” (titanium), “ ” (tungsten), “ ” (uranium), “
” (zinc), and “ ” (zirconium).

The changes of inert elements’ names can be used to
illustrate the methodological shift of nomenclature from
meaningful to phonic names In the very beginning, the
Educational Association and China Medical Missionary
Association did use inert elements’ literal meanings to create
their Chinese names, for example, "閑" (xian, rested, argon),
"曦" (xi, dawn, helium), " " (gas + first, argon), "氜" (gas
+ sun, helium), " " (gas + secret, krypton), and " " (gas
+ fresh, neon). The names created by the European Branch
of the Chinese Chemical Society were all meaningful, such
as "氜" (gas + sun, helium), " " (krypton), " " (neon)
with only one exception " " (gong, argon

The Revised Principles of Chemical Nomenclature, pub-
lished in 1945, only changed three elements’ names. The
changes include from “ ” to “氡” (dong, radon), from
“ ” to “釓” (ga, gadolinium), and from “鈳” to “鈮” (ni,
niobium) [39].

Where do element names come from? Here's a cute  little list.
See the links at the end for some more in-depth resources.


The "picto" column below represents a silly sort of literal interpretation of the radicals that make up the hanzi character.[^hanzidecomposition]

[^hanzidecomposition]: The majority of Chinese characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that part of the character hints about its meaning, and part hints about its pronunciation. And aside from the few elements known to antiquity, the characters for chemical elements tend to follow this same pattern. Non-metals which are solid at STP use a 石 radical, which by itself means stone/rock/mineral. Gaseous elements use 气 (gas/breath/vapor). Metals use 钅, which is a simplified version of 金, meaning gold or metal in general. The other part of the character is a homophone in Mandarin. For example, the 'oxygen' character (氧) is a combination of gas (气) and goat (羊) because oxygen ('yǎng') is a near-homophone for goat ('yáng'). However, the etymology of the spoken word is more likely related to the word for nourishing support (also 'yǎng', 养).




## The seven metals of antiquity

English | Literal | Pinyin | 汉字 | picto 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Iron | strong stuff? | Tiě | 铁 | mistake metal 
Copper | metal from Cyprus | Tóng | 铜 | similar metal (mouth open wide metal)
Silver | ? | Yín | 银 | seventh trigram metal
Tin | ? |  | 锡 | exchange metal
Gold | yellow | Jīn | 金 | metal
Mercury | speed god | Gǒng | 汞 | labor water
Lead | ? | Qiān | 铅 | marsh metal


<!--Another theory, considered far-fetched in some quarters, traces it to Medieval Latin sodanum "a headache remedy," ultimately from Arabic suda "splitting headache."
azoth/azote = lifeless Yang Air
helium aka 氦 sun vapor| Yin Air
