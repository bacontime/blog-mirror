## Rating Meaning

The 1-10 rating thing doesn't really mesh with my thinking. 
So instead, I've tagged movies with symbols indicating where they succeed.
Doubled symbols indicate that a movie is superlative in that regard.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:-:|:-:|
| 😆 | Made me laugh. |
| 💗 | Made me feel things. |
| 👀 | Neat spectacle. |
| 💭 | It's a thinker. |



## Some of My Favorites

[Strictly Ballroom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105488/)
: 💗💗
: It's dorky and quirky, but it's a solidly executed rom com, and I can't help but cry like a baby when I watch it.


[I Am Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6292852/)
: 💗👀💭
: One of the most compelling cinematic depictions of an AI, tight emotional drama, and an amazingly designed pracical-effects robot costume.


[Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/)
: 💭
: Mystery Movie on the Moon.

[Rocket Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120029/) (1997)
: 😆
: I'll be honest. This move is probably objectively trash, and it ranks among my favorites purely for nostalgia's sake.
