## Rating Meaning

The 1-10 rating thing doesn't really mesh with my thinking. 
So instead, I've tagged movies with symbols indicating where they succeed.
Doubled symbols indicate that a movie is superlative in that regard.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:-:|:-:|
| ðŸ˜† | Made me laugh. |
| ðŸ’— | Made me *feel*. |
| ðŸ‘€ | Neat spectacle. |
| ðŸ’­ | It's a thinker. |
| ðŸŽ¼ | The score carries it. |



## Some of My Favorites

[Strictly Ballroom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105488/)
: ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸŽ¼
: It's dorky and quirky, but it's a solidly executed rom com, and I can't help but cry like a baby when I watch it.


[I Am Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6292852/)
: ðŸ’—ðŸ‘€ðŸ’­
: One of the most compelling cinematic depictions of an AI, tight emotional drama, and an amazingly designed pracical-effects robot costume.





## Other Good Movies


[Memories (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113799/)
: ðŸ‘€
: Three animated science-fiction short stories. The first story, *Magnetic Rose*, is especially excellent.

[Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/)
: ðŸ’­
: Mystery Movie on the Moon.

[Rocket Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120029/) (1997)
: ðŸ˜†
: I'll be honest. This move is probably objectively trash, and it ranks among my favorites purely for nostalgia's sake.

[Labyrinth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/)
: ðŸŽ¼ðŸ‘€
: David Bowie steals the show as the scheming ruler of an army of muppets.

[Baahubali](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2631186/) and [its sequel](tt4849438)
: ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
: Basically Hamlet, if Hamlet had superpowers. Borderline-nonsensical action scenes.
