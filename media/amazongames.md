- Golazo!
    - Local: 
    - Okay. Sports.
    - It's a soccer game where you are encouraged to attack the other team. Cute and well made, but didn't really stick for me.
- As Far As the Eye
- Ashwalkers
- Double Kick Heroes
- Two Point Hospital
- Abandon Ship
- In Other Waters
- Fahrenheit Indigo Prophecy
- W2C 7 World Rally Championship
- Paper Beast
- MorkRedd
    - Local:
    - Bad. 
    - Poorly Optimized. Slow. Dull autoscrolling. Stay in a spotlight as it slowly moves along. Pull a lever. Die because the edge detection on the light is iffy.
- Spellcaster University:
    - Okay.
    - I'm a fan of the concept. But the UI design is slapdash, poorly and inconsistently scaled.
- Youtubers Life OMG!
- Tales of Monkey Island
- Demon Hunter 2
- Liberated
- BAFL - Brakes Are For Losers
    - Local:
    - Okay. Cute arcady racer. A bit too chaotic to actually be engaging.
- Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos
    - Local:
    - Good. Zelda Clone Roguelite.
    - There's lots of little side mechanics that don't really have any meat, but the core gameplay loop and combat engine are rock solid.
- Whisky Zombies
    - Local: 
    - Meh. Top-down shooter.
- Song of Horror
- Tiny Robots Recharged
- Blue Fire
- Red Wings Aces of the Sky

    - Local:
- Frog Climbers
    - Local:
- Mana Spark
- Faraway
- Bombslinger
- Healer's Quest
    - Meh. 
    - Only Played a few minutes. Visual style is unique but not super clear. Audio is a mixed bag. Gameplay consists of holding mouse button over a person when their health is low. Might be interesting later in the game, but the hook just isn't there. Cute little experiment though.
- Beholder
- The Blind Prophet
- A Blind Legend
- Edgar Bokbok in Boulzac
- Do Not Feed the Monkeys
- Figment
- Iris and the Giant
- Move or Die
    - Local:
- Before I Forget
- Aces of the Luftwaffe
    - Local:
    - Meh. Shmup
    - I think maybe I just don't like this genre.
- Moving Out
    - Local:
- Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal Age of Resistance Tactics
- Escape Machine City Airborne
- Optica
    - Meh. Puzzle.
    - Perspective gimmick isn't enough to make the game hold my attention.
- Tengami
    - Bad. Nothing
    - I think it's trying to a puzle game. But the gameplay loop is click on a glowing dot, wait a full minute for your little guy to slowly walk over to it, then click on the new glowing dot that appears.
- Blasphemous
- SkyDrift
    - Local:
- Boomerang Fu
    - Local:
    - Good. Brawler.
    - Throw boomerangs to cut your friends in half. Good pace. Interesting power-ups. Cute characters.
- Sine Mora Ex
    - Local:
- The Academy (The First Riddle)
    - Bad. Puzzles.
    - It's a professor Layton style puzzle game, but the instructions and solutions are poorly translated, which ruins it. The *very first* puzzle has a errors in the solution translation. 
- Adventures of Chris
    - Okay. 2D Platformer.
    - Some cute bits, some fun characters. But also some really janky platforming sections.
- Spinch
    - Meh. 2D Platformer.
    - Cute style but nothing special.
- Monster Prom: Hotseat Edition
    - Local: I feel like playing a single game together would be more fun.
    - Good. Dating Sim.
    - It bills itself as a "competitive dating sim", but really it's a sort of parody of dating sims jammed into a rapid-fire choose your own adventure. The goal of a playthrough is ostensibly to find a date to the Monster Prom, but it's more likely you'll get attacked by the Pope for daring to expose the true origins of El Caganer or something like that. One shortcoming is that the game likes to get self-referential, but because the events are random, sometimes it will lampshade an event that you haven't actually seen yet.
- Swimsanity! (local only)
    - Local:
- Table Manners
    - Okay. Goofy simulator.
    - Attempts to be Surgeon Simulator but with a date at a restaurant. The gimmick and presentation are fun, but the game is horribly optimized, and some of the simulation elements are unresponsive. <!-- For example, I struggled to light a candle with a lit match. With this kind of game, they should err on the side of causing chaos. It should be *too easy* to start fires, not too hard.-->

- Victor VRan
- Lethis - Path of Progress
- Extreme Exorcism
    - Okay. Action

- Impulsion
- Tempest
- Shock Troopers
- Ironclad

    - Bad. Point and Click
    - I like the concept of the world (weird worm people living inside a dirt ball) but the game is glitchy, poorly ported from mobile, and wastes just so much time.

- Hover
    - Online Multiplayer
- When Ski Lifts Go Wrong
- Hue
    - Bad. 2D Platformer
    - Simple little game about a small child in a dangerous world. Occasionally it makes you walk through longer corridors while a voiceover waxes philosophically about color. And it irrationally annoyed me because all the stuff it says about colors is BS. No purple is not the farthest color, nor the most difficult for our eyes to distinguish. No, it's not a cultural universal that every culture calls the sky blue. And why on earth does this simple 2D platformer make my graphics card scream out in pain?! Are the background particle effects really that unoptimized?

- Chicken Assassin
- Stealth Inc. 2 
- Yoku's Island Express
- Automachef
    - Bad. Puzzle Thingy
    - One of those automation games, but the hook just isn't good and it starts off with needless complexity.
